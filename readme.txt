- Couple of malicious imps did mess in our project and your job is restore it to its former glory
- Code compilation was tested in node 10 and 12
- Install dependencies using "npm ci"
- Compile assets using "npm run build"
- For your convenience use "npm run watch" while coding
- Files to refactor are located in /src directory
- To preview result run index.html in your browser
- After refactor index.html should look exactly the same
- Structure of matches data should stay intact (that doesn't mean you can't move it around tho!)

Good luck!
